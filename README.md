# Spielidee
Our game is called the Breakout game and is inspired by the famous old game Breakout https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game) and based on this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCqOnchV4V0. 

After Setting up the basic game, Elyess Eleuch started sketching some new ideas for the game. And he came up with the idea that we could instead of just breaking the bricks save a character which is stuck on an Island and surrounded by the bricks.  

## - HauptMechanik
* Set up different levels 
* Start Button
* Ende Screen
* Highscore
* If the character falls out of the screen and doesn't land on the paddle, you lose
* 3 Lives, you have only 3 balls and if you miss them all you lose.
* The scene is completely dark, there are two options the ball can enlighten a small part of the screen or you hit a lamp and the lights will turn on. 
* Different sound effects, for hitting the brick, the paddle, winning and losing

## - Genre & Art Style
* Action game
* Arcade
* Low Poly
